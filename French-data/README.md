## This directory contains the 7k French visual grounding data crowdsourced on Amazon MTurk.

We follow the same data split as in Flickr30k Entities.

Flickr30k Entities has 5 sentences for each image, while we only have one. The sentence appearing in our dataset is the same sentence as in Multi30k's French dataset. 

The numbers of sentences in each set are:
  * training set: 5000 (the first 5000 images in the training set of Flickr30k Entities)
  * validation set: 1014 
  * test set: 1000

The files of split we used is downloaded from here:

https://github.com/multi30k/dataset/tree/master/data/task1  (you can also find other useful data in Multi30k)

The three files involved in our dataset are also uploaded in the folder "split".
